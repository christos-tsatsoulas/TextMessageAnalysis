# TextMessageAnalysis
#Analyzing text message data using Natural Language Processing techniques and libraries. For this project I have chosen The National University of Singapore SMS Corpus dataset, made publicly available by The National University of Singapore. This dataset contains 67,093 text messages (SMSs) taken from the corpus on Mar 9, 2015 and is mostly comprised of messages from Singaporeans and students attending the University.
